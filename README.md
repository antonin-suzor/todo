# todo
TODO app. Start small, then expand.

### Purpose
- Have some fun developing (and hopefully deploying) webapp on my own.
- Build up knowledge to use for other projects.
- If this goes well enough, have a proof of my skills to show to recruiters.
Note: the goal is NOT to build an app that's supposed to have real users.

### Evolutions history
1. Creation of GitHub repository
2. Creation of Node/Vite/SvelteKit directory
3. Development of basic webapp
4. Addition of containerised Postgres database
5. Containerisation of SvelteKit
6. Addition of extra Rust/Actix containerised backend

### Roadmap
- Add containerised Nginx
- Use Kubernetes ?
- Polish the UI
- Deploy on GCP ?
- Use Terraform ?
- Port to desktop using Tauri ?
